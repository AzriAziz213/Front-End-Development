    <b>Setel<br></b>
    Data Science Intern<br>
    Jun 2023 - Sept 2023
    <ul>
        <li>Designed and implemented a data pipeline to handle processing of over 1 million coordinates, converting them into address for data enrichment. Uses Nominatim API for reverse geocoding and processed them in batches in AWS s3. <b>Skills: SQL, Python, reverse geocoding</b></li>
        <li>Actively monitored and maintained data science pipelines developed in SQL and Python, ensuring their seamless operation. I would investigate problems if the pipelines failed and address them, ensuring minimal downtime, and consistently communicated the status to stakeholders. <b>Skills: SQL, Python</b></li>
        <li>Analyzed and revamped SQL logic, originally developed in 2020, for predicting customer attribute. By contrasting it with new user-inputted attribute, I proposed and implemented another SQL logic, enhancing the accuracy of subsequent data science models. <b>Skills: SQL, Python</b></li>
    </ul>
    <b>Agency Nuclear Malaysia</b>
    Engineering Intern<br>
    Jun 2022 - Sept 2022
    <ul>
        <li>Supported my supervisor's PhD research on chiller performance optimization using Genetic Algorithm in MATLAB. Additionally, I delved into various heuristic algorithms, gaining insights into their potential for operational optimization. <b> Skills: Genetic Algorithm, MATLAB</b></li>
        <li>I was tasked to create a simple dashboard with Excel. However, I proposed to use Excel Power Query to aggregate data from multiple sources and built a dashboard from the aggregated data instead. I self learnt how to execute this as there are no with experience in Power Query at the department</li>
